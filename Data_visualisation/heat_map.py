# View correlation matrix as a heatmap
# Below, we render a heatmap in a family of blue colors. Note that the darker the blue, the higher the correlation between a given variable pair. The lighter the blue, the weaker the correlation between variable pairs.

# Heatmap
# A heatmap is a common method of visualizing gene expression changes from among hundreds to thousands of genes from different treatment conditions. 
# The heatmap may also be combined with clustering methods which group genes and/or samples together based on the similarity of their gene expression pattern. 
# This can be useful for identifying genes that are commonly regulated, or biological signatures associated with a particular condition (e.g a disease or an environmental condition).

# Genes are represented in rows of the matrix and chips/samples in the columns. A colored matrix display represents the matrix of values as a grid; the number of rows is equal to the number of genes being analyzed, a
# nd the number of columns is equal to the number of chips/samples. The boxes of the grid are colored according to the numerical value in the corresponding matrix cell (the gene expression values).

# Image: refer to heatmap.png
# You will be able to pick genes based on their expression levels under different conditions. Some may not change but those that do change are of the greatest interest. These indicate gene expression associated with a particular condition. 
# Heatmaps also help one to identify significant groupings among the genes through associations.


# Sample gene expression data set
# Gene names and treatment conditions.
import pandas as pd
from bioinfokit import analys, visuz

df = pd.read_csv("data/data_heatmap/gene_expression.csv")
# set gene names as index
df = df.set_index(df.columns[0])  #This line sets the first column (which contains the gene names) as the index. Now, the gene names are the row labels.
df.head()
#          A	       B	        C	       D	     E	      F

# What the Data Represents:
# Rows: Each row represents a gene (like B-CHI, CTL2, etc.).
# Columns: Each column represents a different condition or treatment (labeled as A, B, C, D, E, F).
# Values: The numbers in the table show the gene expression levels. These can be:
# Positive numbers: Indicate that the gene is upregulated (high expression).
# Negative numbers: Indicate that the gene is downregulated (low expression).

# Example of Interpreting Data:
# For the gene B-CHI under condition A, the expression level is 4.505700, meaning the gene is expressed quite strongly under condition A.
# For the gene CTL2 under condition D, the expression level is -2.57336, meaning the gene is downregulated under condition D.





# Heatmap of gene expression data
# Heatmaps are used to show relationships between two variables, one plotted on each axis. By observing how cell colors change across each axis, you can observe if there are any patterns in value for one or both variables. 
# Below, we use a colormap from red to green with yellow being the central value. The x-axis represents the treatment conditions and the y-axis represents the gene names.

# In heatmaps, the data is displayed in a grid where each row represents a gene and each column represents a sample. The color and intensity of the boxes are used to represent changes (not absolute values) of gene expression. 
# In the following heatmap, red represents down-regulated genes and green represents up-regulated genes. Yellow represents unchanged expression.

# visuz.gene_exp.hmap(df=df, rowclus=False, colclus=False, cmap='RdYlGn', tickfont=(6, 4), show=True)
# image: refer to Heatmap of gene expression data.png



# Let me break down what this line of code is doing:

visuz.gene_exp.hmap()
# This function is from the bioinfokit library and is used to create a heatmap to visualize gene expression data. A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where the individual values are represented as colors, making it easier to detect patterns or anomalies in large datasets.

# Parameters Used in the Code:
# df=df:

# This is the data frame you're passing to the heatmap function. In this case, it's the df containing your gene expression data, where rows represent genes and columns represent treatment conditions.
# rowclus=False:

# This parameter controls whether row clustering should be applied.
# rowclus=False means that the heatmap will not group (or cluster) similar rows (genes). In other words, the rows will be displayed in the original order, without rearranging based on similarity in expression patterns.
# colclus=False:

# This controls column clustering.
# colclus=False means the columns (conditions or treatments) wonâ€™t be clustered based on their similarity. Again, they will remain in their original order.
# cmap='RdYlGn':

# cmap stands for colormap, which defines the color scheme for the heatmap.
# 'RdYlGn' is a color map that ranges from Red to Yellow to Green:
# Red for low values (e.g., low gene expression or downregulated genes),
# Yellow for medium values,
# Green for high values (e.g., high gene expression or upregulated genes).
