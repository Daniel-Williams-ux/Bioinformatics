# csv file
# Below, we will use pandas' read_csv() function to import a heart disease dataset. Pandas imports the dataset as a DataFrame.

# Dataset: This heart disease dataset, from the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository, enables the evaluation of some of the variables that may be predictive of heart disease. 
# Datasets like this, which have a series of predictive variables (called "features" in data science) paired with a known outcome variable (called the "target"), are exteremly useful toward 
# developing machine learning models that can be trained to accurately predict patient outcomes. For example, using this dataset, we could train a model to predict which patients are most likely to suffer 
# from heart disease in the future and are at risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

# sample()
# Instead of having the DataFrame simply return the first five or last five rows, as head() and tail(), respectively, do, the DataFrame's sample() method returns a random sampling of rows from the dataset. 
# The number passed to the method determines the number of rows returned.
