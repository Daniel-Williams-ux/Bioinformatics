We say that a dataset has a normal distribution if its values fall into a smooth (continuous), bell-shaped curve with a symmetric pattern--each side looks the same when cut down the middle. The normal distribution is extremely important to statistics. 
One reason that it's so useful is that it enables us to determine the probability of something occuring due to chance. For example, it enables us to determine the probability that a given data point will fall a given distance from the distribution's mean.
