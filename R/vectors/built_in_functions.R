#Universal (built-in) functions that can be applied to vectors
# Create a vector "v":
​
v = c(25, 9, 16, 4)
v
# 1. 
mean(v)
# Return the mean value of the vector
​
# 2.
sqrt(v)
# Return the square root of each value in the vector
​
# 3.
max(v)
# Return the maximum value in the vector
​
# 4.
min(v)
# Return the smallest value in the vector
​
# 5.
sum(v)
# Return the sum of the values in the vector
​
# 6.
sort(v)
# Sort the values in a vector in ascending order
​
# 7.
sort(v, decreasing=TRUE)
# Sort the values in a vector in descending order
​
# 8.
table(c(20,30,50,20,40,10,40,20))
