# A vectorized operation applies an operation to a vector element-wise:

# 1. # Create a vector named "items":
items <- c(5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40)
items

# 2. # Divide each item in a vector by 5, and return a new vector containing the result
items/5 # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

# 3. # Multiply two vectors together (element-wise).  Return a new vector with the results:
c(1,2,3) * c(2,4,6) # 2, 8 18
