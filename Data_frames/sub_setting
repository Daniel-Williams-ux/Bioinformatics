# Data Frame Subsetting
# You can select a subset of a data frame by placing the desired rows and columns, separated by a comma, within square brackets. You can use either an index position or a name.

# Create a data frame:
​
df <- data.frame(name=c("Carl","Diane","Sally","Ben","Kimmy"),
                 age=c(42,40,17,14,12),
                 sex=c("Male","Female","Female","Male","Female"))
​
df
# A data.frame: 5 × 3
# name	age	sex
# <chr>	<dbl>	<chr>
# Carl	42	Male
# Diane	40	Female
# Sally	17	Female
# Ben	14	Male
# Kimmy	12	Female
